feedbase
--------
--------

Playing around with jRuby and HBase.

Usage:
------
* Create the table with `ruby create_tables.rb`
* Download some demo feeds with `ruby download_latest_feeds.rb`
* Put them in your HBase table with `ruby populate_links_from_feeds.rb`
* Print 'em out with `ruby show_data.rb`

That's almost it. For now.
